# Widgets
## Visualizer
It displays a widget that allows you to plot the data saved in a .csv file from inside the editor, allowing for faster prototyping and debugging. 
It uses the functions defined in *PlottingFunc.py*. Note that if you do not close the widget before closing the editor, the next time you open it it will require you to manually refresh the nodes:

You can do it, or you can use a plugin like [refresh all nodes](https://github.com/nachomonkey/refreshallnodes), which allows you to refresh all the nodes of a blueprint, folder or even your whole experiment.
